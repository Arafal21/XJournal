## üî• 3. Application features & approache:

### ‚úÖ Application Description:


A School Electronic Journal application streamlines communication and organization in schools by providing a centralized platform for managing announcements, student records (including grades, attendance, schedule, and exam calendar), and secure login access. Only the principal has the ability to add new members to the school community, while all users can access their account information via the profiles tab. The application enables teachers to manage students' progress in real-time, keeping both students and parents well-informed about their performance.

The application is optimized for large screens (992px and above, such as laptops and desktops) and mobile devices (320px to 400px), while tablets are excluded due to their low usage (MVP).
MVP - errors messages in some places are limited to alert(), but where there were errors in &lt;p> in the figma, they were applied.

The application has been aligned with the principles of accesibility.

During the development of XJournal, an online gradebook system, I concentrated on delivering a minimum viable product by including only the essential features, which allowed us to efficiently work within the limited time available as our designer and backend developer balanced their primary work commitments. I collaborated closely with a skilled designer and backend developer to deliver a robust and scalable product, and I am excited about the prospect of further expanding its capabilities in future iterations.

experimental approach - sharedClasses.scss - contains 'hiddenOnDesktop', 'hiddenOnMobile' - there is no duplication in the code - in some parts of the application you do not need to specifically create a scss file - the DRY principle is preserved. Common sense has been maintained, and it is not used to every extreme.

I decided to use !important in sharedClasses.scss - because of the specificity. By overlaying ‚ÄòhiddenOnMobile‚Äô on an element that has display: flex to center the elements, the specificity bites (e.g. files. Header.module.scss, ClassSelectMobile.scss). So, in order not to create another container just to give className=‚ÄòhiddenOnMobile‚Äô - I decided to use an important - it should not make future errors with styling.

Visually-Hidden `<h1>`
In `H1Company.tsx` we render our main page title as a real `<h1>`, but hide it from sighted users so it doesn‚Äôt interfere with the UI. Screen-readers still announce it, preserving correct heading structure:

```tsx
import styles from './H1Company.module.scss';

export function H1Company() {
  return <h1 className={styles.srOnly}>XJournal</h1>;
}
```

We use a special .srOnly class (‚Äúscreen-reader only‚Äù) to keep the element in the DOM but visually hidden:

### ‚úÖ Why this approach and not another:

-   In the calendar application, I implemented two separate components‚ÄîCalendarDesktopComponent and CalendarMobileComponent‚Äîto clearly distinguish between desktop and mobile views. This separation ensures a clean and maintainable codebase by isolating platform-specific functionality and layouts.

-   In the Announcements feature, I deliberately chose not to implement useOptimistic updates (React19). Consider the following analogy: on Facebook, when a user clicks "like" on a post, the UI immediately reflects that change‚Äîeven if the backend hasn't fully confirmed it yet. For a social interaction like a "like," this slight is acceptable.
    However, think about a bank transfer: if the transaction were marked as complete on the user's screen before the backend actually processed it, and the user closed the page, it could lead to serious issues. Similarly, in our school application, if a principal were to see an announcement optimistically added and assume it's been saved, only to have it fail on the backend, it could result in critical miscommunications‚Äîlike missing an urgent meeting or failing to broadcast important information.
    By avoiding optimistic updates for announcements, we ensure that when the UI indicates a new announcement, it has been fully verified by the backend, maintaining the integrity and reliability of this crucial functionality.

-   ModalAddNewUserAdmin: In the useEffect we watch isModalVisible, and whenever it flips to true we bump our local modalKey. Passing that key into AdminModalContent forces React to unmount the old instance and mount a fresh one each time the modal opens‚Äîautomatically resetting all internal state (including validation errors) without any manual cleanup.

-   My backend colleague decided not to share his code publicly, so all his collaboration with my changes and commits are on a private repository.
